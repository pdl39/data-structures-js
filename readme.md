## Data Structures

### Implemented in JavaScript

This repository contains implementations of data strcutures in JavaScript:

- various types of commonly used node classes
- linked lists
- stacks & queues
- trees
- graphs
- recursions

I have implemented each data structure as part of my studies to improve knowledge and skills in data structures & algorithms.
